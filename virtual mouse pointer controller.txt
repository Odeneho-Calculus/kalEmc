ðŸ§  Project Brief: Intelligent Eye-Tracking Virtual Assistant for Hands-Free Mouse Control
ðŸŽ¯ Objective:

Develop an intelligent, background-running Python assistant that enables complete control of the mouse pointer through eye movement and blinking patterns, completely independent of any physical input device (mouse, trackpad, or touchscreen). The assistant must support voice-activated wake and shutdown commands, ensuring a seamless, hands-free experience for the user.
ðŸš€ Key Functionalities:
1. Background Service with Activation Keywords

    The application should initialize on system boot or run silently in the background.

    It should remain idle until activated by a customizable voice command such as:

        Wake word: "wake up"

        Shutdown word: "Go to sleep"

    During active mode, it should listen for these commands in real time without interfering with other applications.

2. Camera Access (Cross-Platform)

    Access the device's webcam to continuously capture the userâ€™s face and eye movements.

    Must be compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

    Preferred library: opencv-python

3. Eye and Pupil Tracking

    Detect and isolate the eyes using facial landmarks.

    Track the pupil (dark center of the eye) to determine directional gaze:

        Left â†’ Move mouse left

        Right â†’ Move mouse right

        Up â†’ Move mouse up

        Down â†’ Move mouse down

    Optionally calibrate screen zones for pointer precision.

    Preferred tools: MediaPipe FaceMesh, OpenCV

4. Blink-Based Command Mapping

    Recognize specific blinking patterns as mouse commands:

        Single Blink â†’ Left Click

        Double Blink â†’ Double Left Click

        Long Blink (â‰¥1 second) â†’ Right Click

        Left Wink â†’ Scroll Up

        Right Wink â†’ Scroll Down

5. Mouse Control Integration

    The assistant will translate eye and blink gestures into actual system-level mouse events using:

        pyautogui or pynput for actions like move, click, double-click, and scroll

    Pointer speed and gesture sensitivity should be customizable.

6. System Permissions & Stability

    Ensure the assistant:

        Has permission to access webcam, microphone, and control input devices

        Can run with elevated privileges if necessary

        Handles errors (e.g., camera unavailable) gracefully

        Doesnâ€™t crash or interfere with other processes

7. Lightweight, Modular Design

    Must be modular for easy maintenance and extension.

    Suggested module breakdown:

        voice_listener.py â€“ Wake/shutdown word detection

        eye_tracker.py â€“ Eye and pupil detection logic

        gesture_controller.py â€“ Blink/gaze interpretation

        mouse_controller.py â€“ Interface to system mouse

        main.py â€“ Orchestrator and lifecycle manager

ðŸ§° Suggested Stack:
Purpose	Library
Camera input	opencv-python
Eye detection	mediapipe, dlib (optional)
Mouse control	pyautogui, pynput
Voice activation	speech_recognition, pyaudio, vosk, or whisper
Background execution	pyinstaller or autopytoexe to bundle into a system tray app
âœ… End Goal:

You will have a smart virtual assistant that:

    Runs silently in the background

    Wakes up with a voice command

    Tracks your pupil in real time to move the mouse

    Interprets blinks/winks as mouse gestures

    Shuts down cleanly via a voice command

    Works across major operating systems
